# Insurance Claims & Risk Analysis

## Overview
This project focuses on analyzing insurance claims data using machine learning techniques to understand risk patterns and predict claim behavior. The notebook covers the complete ML workflow, from data preprocessing to model evaluation, enabling data-driven insights for insurance risk assessment.

## Objectives
- Analyze historical insurance claims data  
- Identify key factors influencing claim risk  
- Build and evaluate machine learning models for prediction  

## Workflow
1. Data loading and inspection  
2. Data cleaning and preprocessing  
3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
4. Feature encoding and scaling  
5. Model training and testing  
6. Performance evaluation and interpretation  

## Technologies Used
- Python  
- Google Colab / Jupyter Notebook  
- pandas, numpy  
- matplotlib, seaborn  
- scikit-learn  

## Results
The models provide insights into high-risk claim patterns and demonstrate how machine learning can support insurance risk analysis and decision-making.

## How to Run
1. Clone this repository  
2. Open the `.ipynb` file in Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook  
3. Install required libraries if needed
